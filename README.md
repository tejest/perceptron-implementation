# perceptron-implementation
Python implementation of a Perceptron classifier for a two-class dataset with feature scaling, train-test split, and real-time visualization of decision boundary evolution. Includes predictions on new points and interactive plots to illustrate model learning.
# Perceptron Classifier Visualization

A Python implementation of a **Perceptron classifier** for a two-class dataset with real-time visualization of **decision boundary evolution**.

## Features
- Custom train-test split and manual feature scaling.
- Step-by-step Perceptron learning with weight & bias updates.
- Interactive plots showing decision boundary evolution across epochs.
- Predicts and visualizes new random points relative to the decision boundary.
- Educational tool to understand linear classification.
